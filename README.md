A student manager to find students and add and remove them using C and Tree Structures

## Getting Started

I used DEV c++ to develope this program. At first, I wrote sth to generate a folder of students (generate.cpp file)

## Running the tests

you can compile this:
g++ -O3 -march=native main.cpp -o main
